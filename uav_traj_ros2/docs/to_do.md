# To do 
- [x] Migrate SAS to UAV trajectory ROS2 
- [ ] Write a ROS2 node in cpp to provide waypoints based on location,heading, and leg constraints to get from one point to another
- [x] Visualize waypoints with marker on rviz2
- [ ] Refactor MPC code 
- [x] Have MPC trajectory visualized 
- [ ] Figure out time synch between global planner and MPC planner
  - [ ] Need to set the global planner to where I will be at in the next n seconds, to prevent lag input
